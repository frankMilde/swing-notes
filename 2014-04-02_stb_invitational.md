02.04.2014 class 01 - routine
-----------------------------

* routine and performance to "It ain't mean a thing" by ??
  - RS, around the world
  - l KS, r double K, alternating kicks for 1.5 8counts freeze on C6 (Ll leg last kick + going down on r leg)
  - RS, S, slow CS (r leg over l leg), SS, slow (with full weigth on l leg + bending UB over leg), clap
  - K r leg, SST --> LaF are back to back
  - knee slap r,l,r
  - starting to turn to each other while slaping left knee three times
  - freeze of the "mini dip" --> LaF are SBS
  - tap in front for an 8count
  - shuffling closer together to CP (full 8count)
  - "opposites" L starts back, F starts front (8count)
  - send out to left side, BI with FT, F connects to LrE, walking off stage
* critiques
  - keep going, even if move is botched
  - don't show failure to audience, keep smiling/looking on purpose
  - don't look at feet, look at audiance

09.04.2014 class 02 - musicality
--------------------------------

* preliminary practice
  - feel basic groove rhythm
  - scatting basic "shaacky daa"
  - walk around and bounce
* improvisation
  - build in a break by scatting "Aah" in the _silence_ of "shaacky daa"
  - try while walking around to use any kind of footwork to match your
    scatted break (doesn't have to be a figure)
  - always get back to basic scat and groove walk
  - use only a single body part (head, finger, hip)
  - let the rhythm variation you scat be felt in your whole body and just
    move accordingly
* other basic steps
  - mostly music emphasizes the C2 and C4 (even beats)
  - walking bass line: very beat has emphasis --> dance everything as quick
    step-step-step-step
  - other possibility: dance TS all the time
  - mix up GW, SS, TS 
* how to lead dance modes (GW, SS, TS)
  - SS 
    - dance on one height/level -- imagine you are pull from your sternum forward
    - has almost no bounce, 
    - stay upright and don't bend
    - UB had much more core tension/is more stiff
  - GW
    - much more relaxed UB then SS
    - more bouncy
  - TS
    - lower height/level
    - dance more into the ground
    - more bounce


16.04.2014 class 03 - visual leading/matching energy levels
------------------------------------------------------------

The bottom lines of this class was: 
* if you match the energy levels of your partner it is much easier to dance
  together
* if L get their own solo body movement, posture and inner energy levels
  right, they don't have to worry about actual "leading". Their F will
  automatically feel the correct lead. We can even dance without any
  physical connection.

In general during the exercises the LaF dance in front of one another.
Mostly without connection. Either the L or F leads.

* GW basic with different energy levels
  - challenge: match the energy level of your partner
  - low energy --> very relaxed body and arms
  - high energy --> more core tension in body, arms move more
    energetically
* pay attention to arm movement: leg and arms are always opposites. When
  going into connection always try to aim at that natural position -->
  automatically leads to stretch/connection. 
  - arm movement exercise: go into connection have a basic GW or two, then
    disconnect at any point during the exercise and see if arms
    automatically resume their natural opposite position
* when going for a _hestitation_ tense your whole body, relax when
  finished
  - actively try to have the same energy level in every body part, even ears, nose,
    etc., also match your facial expression
* add UB twist
  - L turn UB right on C1 and/or C5
  - arm movement is always perpendicular to the UB/shoulders
* add KS and mix everything
  - if you go from GW into KS make sure to raise your energy level and body tension
    so your partner can actually see/feel it when it happens
* shuffled TS
  - is 6 count basic
  - for L: on C3 and C4 weight is on leg. r leg shuffles backward
  - for L: on C5 and C6 weight shifts on r leg. leg shuffles forward
  - LrA stays in front from C2 till C6 
* leading visually without connection via own correct body movement
  - leftside, rightside and underarm pass
  - tuck turn
  - swing out


23.04.2014 class 03 - Connection techniques
-------------------------------------------

In general, never stop your (body) movement while dancing. Try to avoid
still points and keep it flowing.

* Ropey style: 
  - no stretch, no hips, nothing
  - be super bouncy, helps you keep the rhythm
  - have a constant speed, tempo in your movement
  - lots of (for the lack of a better word) walking: For L when doing the
    SO, always move backwards on your TS. For the connection this means when
    arms a extended (almost to their maximum) the F should start to move
    towards the L. No stretch though!
* Butt-stretch style: 
  - Your butt keeps moving while your UB comes to a relative halt.
  - this should result in a stretchy feeling. 
  - when the L releases, this should results in the F to move 
  - the tempo of the movement has more of an acceleration feel to it and not
    so much constant
* UB stretch style:
  - by twisting your UB a stretch is created
  - try to **not** twist your feet/lower body
  - for L: always **look** at your Fs

Final exercise was to mix all styles within one dance.


30.04.2014 class 04 - Tempi techniques
--------------------------------------

The music can be interpreted in various ways, which leads to different
styles of dancing onto a given tempo.

* On the beat:
  - every step is exactly on the beat
  - keep moving and bouncing all the time
  - essentially has the **ropey** style of last class
* Behind the beat:
  - build in a lot of delays in your dance (one, twooooo, three and four)
  - essentially has the **stretch** style of last class
* Before the beat:
  - move faster then actual timing to create moments where you can hit a
    break (and let the music catch up)
  - makes it easier to have breaks at fast tempo


07.05.2014 class 05 - Fast dancing
----------------------------------

* Mirroring exercise:
  - Adding TS (face to face)
  - Important: Keep the same bounce; only change the posture (TS are more
    into the ground than steps)
* Weight changes:
  - Important: always move backwards (LaF)!
  - adding TS (slide/shuffle the steps & TS)
* Swing outs:
  - Important: both dancers should always move backwards; It’s important for
    Fs to keep the counterbalance all the time
  - Exercise: Switch between normal tempo and half tempo SO to fast music
  - Important: Keep body movement the same in all tempi
  - Exercise: Switch tempo halftime through the SO
  - Exercise: Fast song with only half tempo SO
  - Exercise: Slow song with only double tempo SO
  - Exercise: Fast (Slow) song with all kinds of moves in
    half/normal(/double) tempo


14.05.2014 class 06 - Swing outs
--------------------------------

Important fact to know about SO: There are many different ways to do the SO,
today we learn the “Eran-version” of it.

* Mirroring exercise: Counterbody shoulder stretch
  - Important: Properly release the shoulder forwards (= Counts “1, 2” in
    the SO)
  - Goal: Catch the F as early as possible
  - Catch the F on the hip
  - Allow F movement to turn the L around (= Counts “3 and 4” in the SO)
* On count “4”: 
  - F be in control of their own body weight (LaF don’t support each others’
    weight but still keep the connection)
* Counts “7 and 8”
  - Accelerating & Decelerating exercise (S, S, TS  side by side):
  - Important: L try to accelerate and decelerate the TS
  - Use the deceleration on 7,8 to prevent swivels  (Fs should try to swivel
    whenever they have the opportunity)
  - Lead the swivels by moving backwards (on 7,8)


28.05.2014 class 07 - Swing outs (Swivel vs TS)
-----------------------------------------------

Remarks on general SO techniques:
* really twist your UB, not only flinging your arms
* don't turn your head, look at your partner instead while twisting UB
* L keep feet/hips straight
* F when in swivels your LB is twisted in the opposite direction of
	your UB twist. That's even harder then for Ls, but suppose to be that way... sorry.

Leading Swivel and TS:
* Fs should always go for the swivel if they can.
* can be lead when on count 6 the L goes backwards with left leg instead of
	forward -->  keep stretch/connection strong so F can swivel
* Swivel on count 7 and 8 is a "Lean,release,lean" from L perspective, which 
  means the connection/stretch is only shortly released and L creates stretch again
* TS is lead via "hug the fat child" or "lean, tension, release", which
	means L really releases the stretch on the last TS so the F cannot swivel
* exercise: LaF are F2F both start rocking from on side to the other, when
	both are in timing, L starts to create a stretch via a RS. L keeps on
	doing a RS where he "Lean,release,lean" and F train to swivel (as on
	counts 1 and 2). At one point L decides to release and F should not be
	able to swivel, but rather to do a TS
