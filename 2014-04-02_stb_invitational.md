-----------------------------

* routine and performance to "It ain't mean a thing" by ??

  - l KS, r double K, alternating kicks for 1.5 8counts freeze on C6 (Ll leg last kick + going down on r leg)
  - RS, S, slow CS (r leg over l leg), SS, slow (with full weigth on l leg + bending UB over leg), clap
  - K r leg, SST --> LaF are back to back
  - knee slap r,l,r
  - starting to turn to each other while slaping left knee three times
  - freeze of the "mini dip" --> LaF are SBS
  - tap in front for an 8count
  - shuffling closer together to CP (full 8count)
  - "opposites" L starts back, F starts front (8count)
  - send out to left side, BI with FT, F connects to LrE, walking off stage
* critiques
  - keep going, even if move is botched
  - don't show failure to audience, keep smiling/looking on purpose
  - don't look at feet, look at audiance

09.04.2014 class 02 - musicality
--------------------------------

* preliminary practice
  - feel basic groove rhythm
  - scatting basic "shaacky daa"
  - walk around and bounce
* improvisation
  - build in a break by scatting "Aah" in the _silence_ of "shaacky daa"
  - try while walking around to use any kind of footwork to match your
    scatted break (doesn't have to be a figure)
  - always get back to basic scat and groove walk
  - use only a single body part (head, finger, hip)
  - let the rhythm variation you scat be felt in your whole body and just
    move accordingly
* other basic steps
  - mostly music emphasizes the C2 and C4 (even beats)
  - walking bass line: very beat has emphasis --> dance everything as quick
    step-step-step-step
  - other possibility: dance TS all the time
  - mix up GW, SS, TS 
* how to lead dance modes (GW, SS, TS)
  - SS 
    - dance on one height/level -- imagine you are pull from your sternum forward
    - has almost no bounce, 
    - stay upright and don't bend
    - UB had much more core tension/is more stiff
  - GW
    - much more relaxed UB then SS
    - more bouncy
  - TS
    - lower height/level
    - dance more into the ground
    - more bounce


16.04.2014 class 03 - visual leading
------------------------------------

The bottom lines of this class was: 
* if you match the energy levels of your partner it is much easier to dance
  together
* if L get their own solo body movement, posture and inner energy levels
  right, they don't have to worry about actual "leading". Their F will
  automatically feel the correct lead. We can even dance without any
  physical connection.

In general during the exercises the LaF dance in front of one another.
Mostly without connection. Either the L or F leads.

* GW basic with different energy levels
  - challenge: match the energy level of your partner
  - low energy --> very relaxed body and arms
  - high energy --> more core tension in body, arms move more
    energetically
* pay attention to arm movement: leg and arms are always opposites. When
  going into connection always try to aim at that natural position -->
  automatically leads to stretch/connection. 
  - arm movement exercise: go into connection have a basic GW or two, then
    disconnect at any point during the exercise and see if arms
    automatically resume their natural opposite position
* when going for a _hestitation_ tense your whole body, relax when
  finished
  - actively try to have the same energy level in every body part, even ears, nose,
    etc., also match your facial expression
* add UB twist
  - L turn UB right on C1 and/or C5
  - arm movement is always perpendicular to the UB/shoulders
* add KS and mix everything
  - if you go from GW into KS make sure to raise your energy level and body tension
    so your partner can actually see/feel it when it happens
* shuffled TS
  - is 6 count basic
  - for L: on C3 and C4 weight is on leg. r leg shuffles backward
  - for L: on C5 and C6 weight shifts on r leg. leg shuffles forward
  - LrA stays in front from C2 till C6 
* leading visually without connection via own correct body movement
  - leftside, rightside and underarm pass
  - tuck turn
  - swing out
