Swing Diary
===========

This repo contains notes on course and workshop material. First aim is to roughly get down what kind of figures/moves where done in a particular class. With passing time the details and comments will be filled in.

Most figures are written from a leaders perspective. Input from follows is more then welcomed. In general this repo should be a collaborative effort, where everybody could (and should) help to expand the diary.
